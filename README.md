#### Description:

Welcome to my presentation for my final project for CS50! I'm Raed from Tunisia, and for my final project, I've created a Portfolio Website hosted using GitHub Pages for its quick and easy setup.

### Introduction:

At the top of the website, visitors will find a brief introduction about me. I'm currently a freshman in computer engineering. My journey into the world of computer science began with a curiosity about technology and a passion for problem-solving. Through courses like CS50, I've gained a solid foundation in programming languages and concepts, and this Portfolio Website serves as a showcase of my skills and projects.

### About Me Section:

The second section provides more detailed information about me, including my education, certifications, and skills. As a lifelong learner, I've embarked on various educational journeys to broaden my knowledge and expertise in computer science. Here, you'll find details about my academic background, including courses I've taken and certifications I've earned. Additionally, I've highlighted my skills in programming languages, software development methodologies, and other relevant areas.

### Work Experience:

While I'm still in the early stages of my career as a computer engineer, I've had the opportunity to gain valuable experience through internships, freelance projects, and academic collaborations. In this section, I've included details about my work experience, including projects I've worked on, roles I've undertaken, and the skills I've developed through these experiences. While my professional journey is just beginning, I'm eager to continue learning and growing in the field of computer science.

### Publications:

In this section, I've curated a collection of publications that highlight my contributions to various events, conferences, and projects. These publications showcase my involvement in the computer science community and provide insights into my areas of interest and expertise. From research papers to blog posts, these publications offer a glimpse into my journey as a computer scientist and the impact I hope to make in the field.

### Contact Form:

Towards the end of the website, there's a small footer offering a way to contact me. While the contact form is not functional yet, I plan to finish it as soon as I have some free time. In the meantime, feel free to reach out to me through other channels listed in the footer, including email and social media platforms.

### Technologies Used:

I've used a basic combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this project. I opted not to learn a new framework like React or Angular to keep the development process straightforward. By sticking to familiar technologies, I was able to focus on creating a functional and visually appealing website without the added complexity of learning new tools.

### Files and Functionality:

1. **index.html**: This file contains the main structure and content of the website, including the introduction, about me section, and contact form. It serves as the entry point for visitors to explore my portfolio and learn more about me.
2. **style.css**: This file contains the CSS styles for styling the website's layout and elements. Through CSS, I've customized the appearance of the website to align with my personal branding and design preferences.
3. **script.js**: This file contains JavaScript code for adding interactivity to the website, such as handling navigation and form submission. By incorporating JavaScript, I've enhanced the user experience and functionality of the website, making it more dynamic and engaging for visitors.

### Design Choices:

I chose a simple and clean design for the website to focus on presenting my information effectively. The use of basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allowed me to create a functional website without the added complexity of learning a new framework. I focused on creating a responsive and accessible design that ensures a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes. By prioritizing usability and simplicity, I aimed to create a website that is easy to navigate and visually appealing.

### Future Improvements:

While the current version of the Portfolio Website serves its purpose, there are areas for improvement and future enhancements. Some potential improvements include:

- Setting up the Contact me form as it doesn't currently work despite being there.
- Completing the contact form functionality to enable visitors to reach out directly through the website.
- Adding more detailed project descriptions and case studies to showcase my work and accomplishments.
- Incorporating multimedia elements such as videos, animations, and interactive components to enhance the visual appeal and engagement of the website.
- Implementing a blog or news section to share updates, insights, and reflections on my journey in computer science.
- Enhancing accessibility features to ensure the website is usable and navigable for all users, including those with disabilities.
